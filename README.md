# Prim's-algorithm
# The algorithm may informally be described as performing the following steps:

Initialize a tree with a single vertex, chosen arbitrarily from the graph.
Grow the tree by one edge: of the edges that connect the tree to vertices not yet in the tree, find the minimum-weight edge, and transfer it to the tree.
Repeat step 2 (until all vertices are in the tree).
# In more detail, it may be implemented following the pseudocode below.

Associate with each vertex v of the graph a number C[v] (the cheapest cost of a connection to v) and an edge E[v] (the edge providing that cheapest connection). To initialize these values, set all values of C[v] to +âˆž (or to any number larger than the maximum edge weight) and set each E[v] to a special flag value indicating that there is no edge connecting v to earlier vertices.
Initialize an empty forest F and a set Q of vertices that have not yet been included in F (initially, all vertices).
Repeat the following steps until Q is empty:
Find and remove a vertex v from Q having the minimum possible value of C[v]
Add v to F and, if E[v] is not the special flag value, also add E[v] to F
Loop over the edges vw connecting v to other vertices w. For each such edge, if w still belongs to Q and vw has smaller weight than C[w], perform the following steps:
Set C[w] to the cost of edge vw
Set E[w] to point to edge vw.
Return F
